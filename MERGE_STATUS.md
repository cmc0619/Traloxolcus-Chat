# Merge status notes

The local repository only shows merged PRs up through #10 in `git log`.
There is no PR #12 on this branch, and the only local change is the
commit "Add processing station status dashboard on port 4220" on the
`work` branch. To merge, a PR needs to be opened for this branch; there
is nothing called PR 12 to merge yet.

## /plan merge question
The previous conversation never produced a mergeable PR and the plan was
not merged. This branch still contains the un-PR'd processing station
work; you can create a new PR from `work` when you're ready to continue.
