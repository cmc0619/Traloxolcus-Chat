# Agent Guidelines

Welcome! This repository captures planning and specs for the multi-camera soccer rig. If you are making changes, keep the following in mind:

1. **Clarity over cleverness.** Favor concise, direct language in docs and comments.
2. **Respect the scope.** Check for nested `AGENTS.md` files when working in subdirectories.
3. **Low ceremony.** Tests are encouraged but not required for documentation-only edits.
4. **Commit confidently.** Small, focused commits are preferred. Just commit it. You're free.

Thanks for keeping the project tidy.
